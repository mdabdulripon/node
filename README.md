# nodejs
**Node js is server side runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It provides an event driven, non-blocking (asynchronous) I/O and cross-platform runtime environment for building highly scalable server-side application using JavaScript.**
- ```I/O``` refers primarily to interaction with the system's disk and network supported by [libuv](http://libuv.org/).

## Advantages of Node js?
- [x] Lightweight framework that includes bare minimum modules. Other modules can be included as per the need of an application.
- [x] Asynchronous by default. So it performs faster than other frameworks.
- [x] Cross-platform framework that runs on Windows, MAC or Linux.

## What is REPL?
**Node.js comes with virtual environment called REPL. REPL stands for Read Eval Print Loop**

## A Node js application consists of the following three important components âˆ’
- [x] Import required modules
- [x] Create server
- [x] Read request and return response 

## Features of Node js -
- [x] Asynchronous and Event Driven
- [x] Very Fast
- [x] Single Threaded but Highly Scalable 
- [x] No Buffering 

## Waht is Buffer?
**Node.js includes an additional data type called Buffer [not available in JavaScript]. Buffer is mainly used to store binary data, while reading from a file or receiving packets over the network.**

## What is process object?
**Each Node.js script runs in a process. It includes process object to get all the information about the current process of Node.js application.**


## Module
**Node js includes three types of modules-**
- [x] Core Modules [http, fs, url and more ]
- [x] Local Modules [created locally in your application]
- [x] Third Party Modules


## Rules:
- [x] Node js is different from JavaScript when it comes to global scope. In the browser's JavaScript, variables declared without var keyword become global. In Node.js, everything becomes local by default.
